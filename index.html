            Hi, there! My name is <b>Muhammed Hilman bin Noorakma</b> and more comfort to be called as Iman among my family. Yeah, even though they named me Hilman but rarely to call me that name at home. I was born on <b>19 March 2001</b> and this year I will turn <b>21 years old</b>. I live with both of my parents in <em>Klang, Selangor</em>. Currently, I am studying for a diploma of <em>Information Management</em> in the last semester. I am studying in <em>Rembau, Negeri Sembilan</em> “supposedly” and sadly, I just have a little memory there since the ODL and stuff started when I was in Semester 2. So, I will finish my diploma at home
            <br> 
            <br>
            Talking about hobbies, I just discovered a new one which is dancing. Maybe I spent a lot of time watching dance videos on YouTube and I got addicted but I don't dance quite often since it requires a lot of time to learn and remember the steps. Dancing has a lot of genres and I'm more into a hip hop dance which has kind of <em>swag vibes</em>. I just hope that I will have a bit of time to discover and try more on the things that I like to do. 
            <br>

            Beside my profile photo is the example of dance video that I always watching

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p></p>
                For my primary school, I schooled at <b>SK Sungai Binjai </b> which is located not far from my house, <em>Meru, Klang</em> . I studied there for 6 years and I got <b>4 A's</b>  for UPSR. Before I pursued my diploma, I was schooled at <b>SMK Meru</b> , <em>Klang, Selangor</em> . Apparently, this school is just opposite of my primary school.  I studied there for 5 years. In PT3, I managed to get <b> 6 A’s</b>. Because of my PT3 result, I got into a science stream course and also learned Accounting. For SPM, I managed to get <b>5 A’s</b>  and one of them was Accounting which made me a bit confused whether to pursue a diploma in Accounting or others. Then, finally I got into the IM course. I admit that Accounting is fun because it is like you playing with money calculation but it is no longer fun until you can't balance the account. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Then lastly, i pursue my diploma in <em>Rembau, Negeri Sembilan</em> . Even though I suffer a bit from learning through online, I still feel grateful that I had a chance to feel memories studying there and have great memories with my housemates and friends. I do have a plan to further my degree but it all depends on the situation. I already applied for <em>“Penerepan”</em>  of degree application and if I succeed to get it, I will start my degree journey approximately in March.

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p></p>
            Talking about experience, I feel excited to share my journey as an IM student. Well, when the first time I applied for <em>UPU</em> , I didn't have much knowledge about this course and I just got a bit of information about it after reading a few blogs. I never expected that through this course, I got to learn a few subjects related to designing and editing stuff which was in semester 2 until semester 5 and it was a fun experience. Learning those subjects also made me think a few times about being a professional in editing and designing works in the future. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For me, semester 4 was the best semester so far because I got to learn about video editing using <b>Adobe Premiere Pro</b>  for the first time in my entire life. Even though I used it for the first time, I can say that I am proud to look at the outcome of my work. I just want to share a quick story of what happened last semester when I was editing a video for my assignment. A few days before submission, I was editing a video and it was kind of 70% done. I thought I would just continue editing it until 2 am and continue for tomorrow. Suddenly, my laptop just restarted by itself before I got to save all the work. It was like having a restart schedule or maybe because I always put it in sleep mode for quite a long time and definitely all the work was gone and I had to redo it again. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Moreover, being an Exco Publicity of <b>Peers Uitm Rembau</b>  club also made me have quite deep interest in doing creative works like creating posters, videos and arranging feed instagram of my club. I have already been involved in doing publicity work for about 2 years and I feel glad to show you guys some of my humble work that I did for my club and also for other projects. In doing creative work, your creativity is the most needed. I admit that I still need to learn more and have to practice often since I am still lacking in a few aspects such as the time consuming and lack of ideas.

            <h2>Family</h2>
            <p></p>
            Talking about my family, Alhamdulillah, I still have both parents by my side. The total siblings that I have is 5 and the 3 above are my sisters and then my special brother. My mother's name is <b>Roslinah binti Moklas</b>  and my father 's name is <b>Noorakma bin Mustapha</b> . Both of them will turn <b>58 years old</b>  this year. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For my siblings, start with my oldest sister, <b> Fatin Najihah, 30 years old</b>. The second one is <b>Farah Athiera, 28 years old</b>  and lastly, <b> Putri Najwa, 26 years old</b>. Alhamdulillah, thrice of them are already married to their lovers one and already have children. My oldest sister has 3 children which are 2 princes and 1 princess. The second one has one princess and the third one also has 1 princess. So , meaning that I already became an uncle. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Lastly, my special brother, <b>Muhammed Syazaney, 24 years old</b> . However, his physical appearance does not reflect his age since his growth already stopped a long time ago. He is an <em>OKU</em>  who is diagnosed with <em>Epilepsy</em> , or also well known as <em>“Sawan”</em> .  Even though I'm the youngest, I will treat him as my younger brother since he is no different as a kid who is still playing kids games like lego at the age of 24.
